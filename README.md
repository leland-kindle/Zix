# Zix
Zix is a program that will allow you in any way possible to do whatever you want. All of our files will be highlighted perfectly so you know exactly what it does. We have things like break my Mac, which will of course fry your hardware and break your Mac if you want these tools just go to our Release's page and we release every release for everything possible. We'll let you know which things we are updating and removing every time you do this and each time that we remove something, we will compensate it with possibly each time we do it we will compensate it with a brand new program. If I can't get a brand new program to you I'll find some other way to get it to you.
